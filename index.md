EMPHYSIS (Embedded systems with physical models in the production code software) is an ITEA3 research project that is running Sept. 2017 - Feb. 2021. The major goal of the EMPHYSIS project is to develop a new standard eFMI (FMI for embedded systems) to exchange physics-based models between modelling and simulation environments with software development environments for electronic control units (ECU), micro controllers or other embedded systems and provide prototype implementations for the whole tool chain from physics-based modeling environments to production code on electronic control units.
